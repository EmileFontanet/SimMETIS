# Development plan / Milestones

## after PDR
- include long-slit spectroscopy
- after final detector choice
  - possibly include Q band
  - more realistic implementation of detector noise (ELFN / non-linearity / non-reciprocity for Aquarius; correlated noise for Hawaii), dependent on final detector choice
- N band: add emission from window and spiders
- Define direction of North/East in data cube (wish from Inga Kamp)

## after FDR
- simulate raw-data and process them via the pipeline
