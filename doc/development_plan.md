# Development plan / Milestones

## 0.2 (December 2018) "PDR version"
- LMS (IFU spectroscopy) radiometry (signal/noise rate) implemented

## after PDR
- include long-slit spectroscopy
- Q band
- more realistic implementation of detector noise (ELFN / non-linearity / non-reciprocity for Aquarius; correlated noise for Hawaii)
- N band: add emission from window and spiders
- create simulated data suitable for development of prototypes of
  pipeline algorithms

## after FDR
- simulate raw detector frames that mimic the format of METIS raw data
  and are ready to be processed by the pipeline demonstrator
