# Development plan / Milestones
## 0.1 (October 2018)

#### Goals
- Simcado with bug fixes to support simulations at 3-20 microns
- Configuration files for METIS L and N band imaging
- Transmission curves (sky emission / absorption, mirror reflectivity, entrance window, detector QE, dichroic transmission, filter curves) extended and/or adapted for METIS L and N bands
- iPython notebooks with example use cases for both LM and NQ band imaging
- output fluxes in L and N band imaging verified against Royâ€™s fluxes document

#### Work to be done
- N band
	- integrate ELFN noise penalty according to Fig. 7 of Roy's fluxes technote (v 0.8) [Kieran]
	- check source photons (mag_to_photons function) [Oliver, Leo]
	- background flux
		- add atmospheric transmission and emission [all]
		- add emission from window and spiders [all]
- verify correct fluxes and behaviour also in L and M band [Enrico, Leo]
- clean-up test notebooks [Leo]
- clean-up and document example notebooks [Leo]


## 0.2 (December 2018)
- LMS (IFU spectroscopy) radiometry (signal/noise rate) implemented

## after PDR
- include long-slite spectroscopy

## after FDR
- simulate raw-data and process them via the pipeline
