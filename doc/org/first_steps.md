# First steps
We recommend to get familiar with the simulator by reading / re-executing and modifying the example notebooks that are part of the package. This way you learn both about the features of the simulator as well as input and output formats and you can quickly adapt these notebooks for your own purposes.

Additional information can be found in all SimMETIS objects. Within the convenient iPython environment you can both use tab completion as well as the `?`syntax, i.e.

#### Tab completion

`import simMETIS as sim`

`sim.` (then type the tabulator twice to see all methods of this object)

#### Question mark syntax
Type
`?sim.OpticalTrain`
to get an inline help of this particular object.
