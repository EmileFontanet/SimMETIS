# Download and installation instructions

## Standard installation
Please download the .tar.gz bundle, unpack it at a directory of your choice (e.g. ~/SimMETIS) and install the package in your existing Python 3 installation by executing within the SimMETIS directory this command:

`pip install .`

We recommend using the interactive Python shell iPython as well as running your scripts in notebook mode using Jupyter. You will also need the (very common) numpy, astropy and matplotlib packages.

## Developer installation
Alternatively, you can clone our github repository and run pip install in your local directory.
